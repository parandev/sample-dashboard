                    Throughput is a measure of efficiency. It is meant to represent the maximum number of vehicles
                    served on all phases at an intersection.

                  <Typography paragraph>
                    The number shown for the average is an average of all the individual signals based on the current
                    filter. The charts display an average of every signal in the respective corridor.

                    It is calculated as the highest 15-minute volume in a day at an intersection, converted to an hourly
                    volume. Volumes come from high-resolution event logs from the controller, which are stored in the
                    ATSPM database. All detectors used for volume counts are used in the throughput calculation for an
                    intersection. It includes Tuesdays, Wednesdays and Thursdays only.

                  <Typography paragraph>
                    Detectors used for volume counts are selected based on a hierarchy, as there may be more than one
                    detector in a given lane. For each lane, the detector with the highest count priority is selected
                    for the count-based metrics. The priority scale is as follows:

                  free-flow conditions. A TTI of 1.3 means that a trip takes 30% longer during peak periods than during
                  free-flow conditions.
